# Water-holding capacity measurements

# Britt helped me. Notes from that meeting:
Put cheesecloth, rubberband, wrap in electical tape, on bottom of sample. Label it here. 
Attach metal ring to top with electrical tape. 
Soak in 0.01 M CaCl (may need to make). CaCl is to eliminate the osmotic potential differences that may drive water flow.
Put samples in the big glass vacuum thing, fill to top of bottom ring. 
Apply vaccuum for 2-3 minutes. Let sit for 12-24 hours. Can do 10 samples at a time.

Weigh all cylinders and label them to match their cell. 

Bring in saturated soil sample, get weight, then move it to the cell and weigh the water left in the cup. 
Dip a filter paper (white) in CaCl, place on cell bottom, put greased ring on top of it.
Place soil sample in pressure cell.
Let it sit for 3 hours at atmospheric pressure (no pressure applied). 
Weigh cylinder + water. 

He does 10, 25, 50, 100, 200, and 500 pressures. The 100-500 must be measured using the mercury scale. 
10 for 12 hours, 25, 50, 100, 200 are done for 24 hours, and the 200 and 500 are done for 48 hours. 

Open the cells one by one and make sure the pressure holds. Between pressure changes, close them all, readjust the pressure, then open one at a time. 



# Start with Stout samples. Only have 9, because we took an extra 'no cover crop' one. 

7/30 - Put Stout samples into vacuum thing for soaking. Attached rings to all other samples. 
7/31 - Weighed saturated samples. Put Stout samples into pressure cells at atmospheric pressure (~2.5 cm H2O, I think) (10am)
8/1 - Weighed water+cylinder. Applied 10 cm h2o pressure to cells (8:30am)
* 2.5 cm h2o for 22 hours
